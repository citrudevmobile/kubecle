Crypto Payday Loans on Hosted PWA (Progressive Web Application)

Kubecle is a new financial vehicle meant to revolutionize access to funds for those who create value. 

Crypto payday loans on hosted PWA (progressive web apps). For example, Flippa (https://flippa.com/) enables anyone to sell their digital asset. What about a scenario where you don't want to sell your digital asset? But you need access to funds. I thought to myself that I should be able to get a payday loan using my hosted application. In simple terms, the hosted application can be put into an escrow, and anyone can crowdfund the loan. When the loan is paid, the application is moved out of escrow. When the loan is defaulted on, the hosted application will be liquidated (ex., sold on Flippa). What do you think?

If you think this is such a great idea, why should it be open source when many competitors would be scrambling to implement the idea as proprietary software and make a profit?

This is what I think: we are creating a new standard. We are taking inventory of what we consider to have value and pairing it with other valueable digital assets. Example: Bitcoin vs. PWAÂ 

Therefore, the core (PWA escrow) that enables this interaction should be open source, and then we can build many applications on top of that.
